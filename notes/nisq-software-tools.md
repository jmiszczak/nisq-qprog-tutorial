# Software tools for NISQ computers

**Abstract**: This document contains a list of simulation software, computer algebra packages, language libraries, and other resources relevant for the development of software for noisy, intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) computers.

## Computer algebra tools

### Mathematica

#### Qi

QI is a package for Mathematica computer algebra system developed to support symbolic analysis of quantum states and operations.

## Language packages

### Python

#### Orquestra

Orquestra automates the management of your quantum stack, from software to hardware.

Orquestra® is the unified software platform for building, orchestrating and deploying quantum-ready applications™. These applications use both quantum and classical technologies, and are built to be forward-compatible with the latest software and hardware as they evolve due to Orquestra’s computational workflow paradigm

#### QuTip

#### Qiskit

#### PyQuill

#### Tequilla


Tequila is an abstraction framework for (variational) quantum algorithms.
It operates on abstract data structures allowing the formulation, combination, automatic differentiation and optimization of generalized objectives. Tequila can execute the underlying quantum expectation values on state of the art simulators as well as on real quantum devices.

####

The tket framework is a software platform for the development and execution of gate-level quantum computation, providing state-of-the-art performance in circuit compilation. The toolset is designed to aid platform-agnostic software and extract the most out of the available NISQ devices of today.
