\begin{abstract}
The possibility of using quantum computing devices for delivering speed-up unachievable for classical, digital computers is one of the most important motivation for the recent progress in quantum technologies. To asses the actual capabilities of quantum technologies it is necessary to take into account
The goal of this \docName is to provide an overview of the recent attempts to utilize quantum computing technologies for solving optimization problems based on real-world data. In contrast to general reviews in this area, we focus on cases where quantum solution is developed for a realistic dataset and can be translated into the solution usable in real-world applications, and where  the solution obtained using quantum computing approach is benchmarked against solutions obtained using the standard, classical methods. Hence, we provide a catalogue of cases with

\section{Introduction}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The goal of this \docName is it provide an overview of the recent attempts to utilize quantum computing technologies for solving optimization problems arising in real-world scenarios. To this end we focus on the selected demonstrations of quantum methods for solving optimization problems having two particular features.

First, we are mostly interested in cases where quantum solution is developed for a realistic dataset and can be translated into the solution usable in real-world applications. This is a severe limitation as most of the studies utilizing quantum computing for optimization problems are based on toy models, and are aim at demonstrating the feasibility of the approach based on quantum computing. However, one should note that, as quantum computing provides an universal model of computation, using quantum computing is always possible. Hence, in most cases developing efficient quantum solutions required a in-depth understanding of quantum computing and the particular problem to be solved using quantum computer. For this reason quantum programming and quantum software development education is crucial~\cite{salehi2022computer}.

Second, as we are interested in actually assessing the usability of quantum technologies, we focus on the application where the solution obtained using quantum computing approach is benchmarked against solutions obtained using the standard, classical methods. Hence, we aim at applications where authors provide a quantum as well as a classical solution, along with strengths and weaknesses of both approaches. This ensures that the sound comparison between the quantum and the classical approaches is possible for each case.

An overview of commercial applications of quantum computing, identifying  quantum-safe encryption, material and drug discovery, and quantum-inspired algorithms among the most promising quantum applications is provided in \cite{bova2021commercial}. 

Recent overview of the progress in the area of quantum annealing (QA), also knows a adiabatic quantum computation (AQC) or Quantum Adiabatic Algorithm (QAA), is provided in~\cite{yarkoni2022quantum}. With regard to combinatorial optimization, authors identify mobility, scheduling, and finance as the most promising areas of application for quantum computing technologies.



One of the crucial element of the quantum computing ecosystem is software supporting quantum computing technologies. A comparison of quantum computing software platforms is provided in~\cite{larose2019overview} and recent surveys of the progress and trends in the field can be found in \cite{zhao2020quantum}, \cite{gill2021quantum} and \cite{miszczak2023symbolic}. Also, the hand-on approach to the utilization of quantum optimization can be found in~\cite{combarro2023practical}.

Finally, one should could also consider the high-level overview of the quantum computing technologies from the economical and legal perspective.
The study presented in \cite{seskir2021landscape} provides an analysis of the research activities in the field of quantum technologies. An in-depth analysis of the recent explosion of commercial interest in quantum technologies can be found in~\cite{seskir2022landscape}. Finally, various political and legal aspects of quantum technologies are discussed in~\cite{hoofnagle2021law}.

Authors of \cite{choi2019tutorial} provide an in-depth exploration of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), which offers significant improvements in solving various combinatorial optimization problems, as well as delves into the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz and its applications,  to explain the concept of approximate optimization. In \cite{ruan2023quantum} authors provide a formal description of encoding methods for different types of constraints. They also provide examples of using the proposed scheme for some well-known optimization problems.

In \cite{crosson2021prospects} the assessment of the possibility for QA to 
achieve quantum speed-up relative to classical state-of-the-art methods is provided.

\section{Transportation}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Being one of the largest areas of industry, transportation provide a natural area for harnessing the potential offered by quantum computers.

\subsection{Vehicle routing}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One of the first real-word applications of QA for traffic optimization was proposed in~\cite{neukart2017traffic} as a part of collaboration between Volkswagen and D-Wave Systems. In this work parts of a real-world traffic flow optimization problem were mapper to a form suitable for QA devices. Additionally, a benchmarking of the quantum solution against the random assignment was provided.

In \cite{borowski2020new} two hybrid algorithms and fully quantum solutions for Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) were introduced and compared with classical solution. Introduced algorithms are benchmarked using D-Wave framework on a well-established set of benchmark test cases. Additionally, the algorithms are run on test scenarios built based on realistic road networks.


The benchmarking of quantum solution for vehicle routing against Gurobi was provide in \cite{anil2022performance}. Authors compared time required to find a solution as well as the quality of the solution for D-Wave Hybrid and  Gurobi v9.5. The results suggest that the scaling of quantum annealer devices is better comparing with the classical approach.

\subsection{Railway management}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Another area of application which is studied in the context of quantum computing technology is the railway dispatching and management.


In \cite{domino2022quadratic} the problem of rescheduling of railway traffic due to disruptions. The problem is encoded into QUBO and HOBO formulations, and solved using D-Wave Advanatage. The major drawback of the quantum approach is the number of qubits available on current devices, whcih severly limits the usability of the proposed models. The benchmarking of the solution based on D-Wave against the classical solution is provided in \cite{domino2023quantum} and it clearly demonstrates that the utilization of current QA devices is very limited in the aspect of railway management in realistic scenarios.

\section{Finance}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Utilization of quantum computing technologies in finance can be seen as the most direct rout for commercializing their potential. This could be achieved by using quantum computing optimization routines in applications related to managing money. For this reason several introductory articles targeted at financial professionals and books are available.

In \cite{orus2019quantum} authors provided an overview of possible quantum computing approaches to financial problems. In particular, they provide an overview of current approaches and potential prospects, including the discussion of how QA can be used to portfolio optimization, arbitrage opportunities finding, and credit scoring.

Selected applications of quantum computing for finance, focusing on portfolio optimization, are discussed in \cite{bouland2020prospects}. Here, the focus is on  the relevance of quantum algorithms for finance in the near-term perspective. Authors stress that some of the some of the quantum algorithms for finance problems are expected to provide speed-ups only in the case of when larger-scale quantum computers are available. Additionally, they discuss methods for to bringing these speed-ups closer to experimental feasibility by describing lower depth algorithms for Monte Carlo methods and QA heuristics for portfolio optimization.

A hybrid quantum-classical solution method to the mean-variance portfolio optimization problems is developed in~\cite{venturelli2019reverse}. The benchmarking samples are in this case based on the parametrized samples of portfolio optimization based on real financial data statistics and following the principles of the Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT).


Quantum algorithm for Credit Risk Analysis (CRA) was introduced in~\cite{egger2021credit}. Authors implemented the considered problem for a realistic loss distribution. Moreover, they analysed the scaling  for the case of a realistic problem size. One should note, however, that in this case it is assume that the fault-tolerant quantum device is available. A variant of this algorithm overcoming some limitation of the original proposal has been described in~\cite{dri2022towards,dri2023more}.
